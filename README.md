IUG 2026 - The Great ILS-Data Preconference: Quick Lessons With Your Peers

Ease your way into this year's conference with our all-star assortment of IUG experts who will present a full afternoon of activities for those looking to expand their library data toolbox.  Through a series of mini-talks, some speed geeking and lively conversations, attendees will have opportunities to learn about a wide range of techniques for working with both Sierra and Polaris data.

Individual Sessions include:

* __DASHboard Confessional: Revealing the secrets of data visualization__
 
  In this quick session we'll explore how to structure and manage data in order to create a variety of data visualizations and see plenty of examples of data dashboards that have been constructed for the Minuteman Library Network.
* __Vega Kiosks__
* __Finding Signal in the Noise with Regex__
  
  A fast, hands-on session on using regular expressions to spot patterns and transform messy text. See how regex skills can work everywhere—from command-line tools and text editors to MarcEdit—to search, clean, and reshape data.

* __From Create Lists to Action: Empowering Staff with API-Driven Micro-Projects__
  
  Create Lists don’t have to stop at reporting. This speed-geeking session explores how curated lists can feed API-based scripts to safely delegate real work, such as patron address cleanup or fine removal for special cases, to staff. A fast, approachable model for extending capacity without building large systems.
* __I ❤️ Datasette: A Tool for Exploring and Publishing (Library) Data__
  
  Datasette is a free and open-source software platform designed by Simon Willison to make it easier to share and publish data. At the Cincinnati & Hamilton County Public Library I have been using Datasette in a variety of ways to help explore and share Library data in useful and meaningful ways that I’ll demo here.
* __Out Here in the Fields: Lessons Learned from a Different Database__
  
  You may not believe this, but there is an entire world of library management systems outside professional librarianship, each with their own databases and schemas that bring their own pros and cons. And get this: None of them use MARC. I mean, can you imagine?! Let’s take a quick walk through a project that manages bibliographic data in a completely different way, and what we can take away from that.

* __Data Lakes/warehouses and storing data extracts__

* __Putting Privacy First: Making Due with Less Data__
  
  The Minuteman Library Network has historically taken a privacy first approach to its policies and data retention practices.  We only store a month of circ transaction data in Sierra, take great caution with the data we share with other vendors and refuse to use a number of standard features such as linked patrons.  Massachusetts is now on the verge of implementing a new data minimization focused privacy law that has had us looking at reducing data collection even further (do we really need patron addresses?  Yes, but we thought about it).  Come and hear how we are able to balance these considerations with our vast reporting needs and still manage to operate a successful consortia.
* __Altering the Position of Matter: Fear, Loathing, and Circulation methodology__
  
  The actual physical act of circulation is like Cotton-Eyed Joe, because what you’re really interested in is “where does it come from” and “where does it go.” Far too many libraries don’t survey the movement of materials through their facilities to see if there are better, and hopefully easier, ways to get items into the hands of patrons and then back on the shelves thereafter. I’ll walk you through a quick rundown on how process evaluation, logistics, and a whole lotta data can smooth transitions from checkout to shelf and back again.
* __AMH Insights: Turning Log Files Into Actionable Data__

  Automated Materials Handling (AMH) systems generate valuable operational data, much of which resides in plain-text log files that are rarely analyzed beyond troubleshooting. This ILS-agnostic lightning talk introduces a practical approach for extracting insights directly from AMH logs to better understand item flow, bin utilization, and system behavior.
  
  Using TechLogic as an example, while keeping the methodology applicable to other AMH vendors, the session outlines how libraries can automate the collection of AMH log files from the system’s main application computer and deliver them to a centralized location for analysis using common automation tools such as PowerShell and WinSCP. By examining this data over time, libraries can identify heavily used bins, uncover patterns in items routed to Exceptions, and use volume-based evidence to inform bin redistribution, mapping adjustments, and operational tuning, independently of the ILS.
